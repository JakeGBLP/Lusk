@Name("Dolphin - Treasure Chest Location")
@Description("""
Gets the treasure location the provided dolphins try to guide players to.

This value is calculated if the player has fed the dolphin a fish (which Lusk includes), `DOLPHIN_SWIM_TO_TREASURE` goal.

Can be set, but it only has an effect if the dolphin is currently leading a player, as this value is recalculated next time it leads a player.

The world of the location you give it does not matter, as the dolphin will always use the world it is currently in.
